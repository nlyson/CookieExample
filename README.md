Here is how to check out my repository.

1) Make sure you have Git installed. (I don't know how to do this on Mac)  https://git-scm.com/download/mac

2) Open Git Bash app you just installed.

3) Go to the directory where you want to put this and run the following command: git clone https://github.com/nlyson/CookieExample

4) Run this command: cd CookieExample/Website

5) Run this command: python3 -m httpServer

6) Open and incognito window in Chrome and go here:  localhost:8000

7) To play around with the code and try some stuff with cookies, edit this file:  CookieExample/Website/index.html. Then, reload the page. (Or close and reopen incognito window)
